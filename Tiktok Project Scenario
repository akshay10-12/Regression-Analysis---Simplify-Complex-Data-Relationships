TikTok users have the ability to submit reports that identify videos and comments that contain user claims. These reports identify content that needs to be reviewed by moderators. The process generates a large number of user reports that are challenging to consider in a timely manner. 

TikTok is working on the development of a predictive model that can determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion. With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently. TikTokâ€™s data team is working on the claims classification project. The following tasks are needed at this stage of the project:
1. Determine the correct modeling approach
2. Build a regression model
3. Finish checking model assumptions
4. Evaluate the model
5. Interpret model results and summarize findings for cross-departmental stakeholders within TikTok
